" RUNNING TESTS
"
" Test running here is contextual in two different ways:
"
" 1. It will guess at how to run the tests. E.g., if there's a Gemfile
"    present, it will `bundle exec rspec` so the gems are respected.
"
" 2. It remembers which tests have been run. E.g., if I'm editing user_spec.rb
"    and hit enter, it will run rspec on user_spec.rb. If I then navigate to a
"    non-test file, like routes.rb, and hit return again, it will re-run
"    user_spec.rb. It will continue using user_spec.rb as my 'default' test
"    until I hit enter in some other test file, at which point that test file
"    is run immediately and becomes the default. This is complex to describe
"    fully, but simple to use in practice: always hit enter to run tests. It
"    will run either the test file you're in or the last test file you hit
"    enter in.
"
" 3. Sometimes you want to run just one test. For that, there's <leader>T,
"    which passes the current line number to the test runner. RSpec knows what
"    to do with this (it will run the first test it finds at or below the
"    given line number). It probably won't work with other test runners.
"    'Focusing' on a single test in this way will be remembered if you hit
"    enter from non-test files, as described above.
"
" 4. Sometimes you don't want contextual test running. In that case, there's
"    <leader>a, which runs everything.
