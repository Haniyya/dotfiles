If you use Homebrew to install vim, following is what you can do to fix this issue:
0. Update Homebrew (optional): brew update
1. If you already installed vim use Homebrew, remove it: brew remove vim
2. Use the system Ruby to compile and install vim: rvm system do brew install vim
3. Make an alias for vim: alias vim='rvm system do /usr/local/bin/vim $@'
